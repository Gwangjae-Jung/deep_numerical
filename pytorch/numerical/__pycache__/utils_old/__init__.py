# """## The utility module for implementing numerical methods for the Boltzmann equation

# -----
# ### Description
# This module provides various functions which can be used to implement numerical methods for solving the Boltzmann equation.
# In this module, the following features are provided:
#     * `_dtype` (copied from `utils_main`)
#         provides several type hints which are used throughout this package.
#     * `_helper` (copied from `utils_main`)
#         provides several helper functions which are used throughout this package.
#     * `_constants`
#         provides several constants which are used throughout this package.
#     * `_fft_utils`
#         provides several helper functions for the FFT operations and its application (for example, efficient convolutions).
#     * `_math`
#         provides several frequently used math functions.
#     * `_num_int`
#         provides several functions for numerical integration.
#     * `_quadrature`
#         provides several quadrature rules, which can be easily applied in practice.
#         It also provides several grids on compact boxes, disks, and spheres.
#     * `_runge_kutta`
#         provides several Runge-Kutta methods for a single march.
#     * `_grid`
#         provides several functions which generates the uniform regular grid on a given box.
